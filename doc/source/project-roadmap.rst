Project roadmap
===============

The list below gives some features we plan to include until the release of pnb.mcl 1.0. There is no fixed order, but the list gives a rough estimate of priority (from high to low):

- "inverse" property navigation
- class properties
- safe importers and exporters
- support for profiles (customization of existing models)
- support for property redefinitions in subclasses
- class properties
- safe importers and exporters
- methods

In parallel:

- completion of documentation
- full test coverage
